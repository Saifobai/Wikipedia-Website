    <h1>Pasta</h1>

    <h4>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h4>

    <h3>History</h3>

    <p>In the 1st century AD writings of Horace, lagana (singular: laganum) were fine sheets of fried dough[9] and were an everyday foodstuff.[10] Writing in the 2nd century Athenaeus of Naucratis provides a recipe for lagana which he attributes to the 1st century Chrysippus of Tyana: sheets of dough made of wheat flour and the juice of crushed lettuce, then flavoured with spices and deep-fried in oil.[10] An early 5th century cookbook describes a dish called lagana that consisted of layers of dough with meat stuffing, an ancestor of modern-day lasagna.[10] However, the method of cooking these sheets of dough does not correspond to our modern definition of either a fresh or dry pasta product, which only had similar basic ingredients and perhaps the shape.[10] The first concrete information concerning pasta products in Italy dates from the 13th or 14th century.[11]

        Historians have noted several lexical milestones relevant to pasta, none of which changes these basic characteristics. For example, the works of the 2nd century AD Greek physician Galen mention itrion, homogeneous compounds made of flour and water.[12] The Jerusalem Talmud records that itrium, a kind of boiled dough,[12] was common in Palestine from the 3rd to 5th centuries AD.[13] A dictionary compiled by the 9th century Arab physician and lexicographer Isho bar Ali[14] defines itriyya, the Arabic cognate, as string-like shapes made of semolina and dried before cooking. The geographical text of Muhammad al-Idrisi, compiled for the Norman King of Sicily Roger II in 1154 mentions itriyya manufactured and exported from Norman Sicily: </p>

    <h3>History of manufacturing</h3>

    <p>At the beginning of the 17th century, Naples had rudimentary machines for producing pasta, later establishing the kneading machine and press, making pasta manufacturing cost-effective.[24] In 1740, a license for the first pasta factory was issued in Venice.[24] During the 1800s, water mills and stone grinders were used to separate semolina from the bran, initiating expansion of the pasta market.[24] In 1859, Joseph Topits (1824−1876) founded the first pasta factory of Hungary in the city of Pest, which worked with steam machines; it was one of the first pasta factories of Central Europe.[25] By 1867, Buitoni Company in Sansepolcro, Tuscany became an established pasta manufacturer.[26] During the early 1900s, artificial drying and extrusion processes enabled greater variety of pasta preparation and larger volumes for export, beginning a period called "The Industry of Pasta".[24][27] In 1884, the Zátka Brothers's plant in Boršov nad Vltavou was founded and this was the first pasta factory in Bohemia.[28]</p>
